Description: An efficient implementation of the TreeSHAP algorithm introduced by Lundberg et al., (2020) <doi:10.1038/s42256-019-0138-9>. 
    It is capable of calculating SHAP values for tree-based models in polynomial time. 
    Currently supported models include 'catboost', 'gbm', 'randomForest', 
    'ranger', 'xgboost', 'lightgbm'.
